**Machine Learning Project Repository**

**Welcome to my Machine Learning Project Repository!**

This repository contains 10 diverse machine learning projects, each addressing real-world problems and showcasing various machine learning techniques. These projects were developed to explore, analyze, and predict data-driven insights using supervised and unsupervised learning models.

Each project includes a detailed analysis of the problem statement, implementation of algorithms, and insightful outcomes. Below are the titles of the projects included in this repository:

**Project List**

**1) Breast Cancer Prediction**
A classification model to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on medical data.

**2) Customer Segmentation on Purchasing**
Clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

**3) Calories Burnt Predictions**
A regression model to predict calories burned during physical activities.

**4) Big Mart Sales Prediction**
Predicting sales for Big Mart stores using regression models.

**5) Car Price Prediction**
Estimating car prices based on features such as make, model, and mileage.

**6) CGPA Prediction**
Predicting the CGPA of students based on academic and demographic factors.

**7) Credit Card Fraudulent Transaction Detection**
A classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**8) Diabetes Prediction**
A model to classify whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on health indicators.

**9) Fake News Prediction**
A classification model to identify and flag fake news articles.

**10) Calories Burnt Predictions**
Another approach to calories burned, using advanced feature engineering.




**About the Repository**

Each project is organized in its respective folder, containing:
The code implementation (Python notebooks or scripts).
Relevant documentation.
Preprocessed datasets or links to the original datasets.
The repository is designed to be a hands-on resource for machine learning enthusiasts and developers who wish to learn from and adapt these models for their own use.

**Requirements**

Before running the projects, ensure you have installed the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. (Refer to individual project documentation for additional libraries).
